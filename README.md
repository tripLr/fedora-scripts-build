# fedora-scripts-build
scripts to setup and build android using fedora server 

android developers typically use virtual machines using ubuntu
and ubuntu packages are described in android developer for a build environment
I have translated and tested line by line scripts using ubuntu into fedora packages
I am using fedora on a server to build, and although I could run ubuntu in a VM or container 
I am going to use baremetal for this try.
